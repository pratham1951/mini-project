        Use these helpers for quickly configuring the position of an element.


                                                        Fixed top

        Position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge. Be sure you understand the 
        ramifications of fixed position in your project; you may need to add additional CSS.
        
        div class="fixed-top">.../div


                                                     Fixed bottom

        Position an element at the bottom of the viewport, from edge to edge. Be sure you understand the 
        ramifications of fixed position in your project; you may need to add additional CSS.
        
        div class="fixed-bottom">.../div


                                                        Sticky top

        Position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge, but only after you scroll past it. The 
        .sticky-top utility uses CSS’s position: sticky, which isn’t fully supported in all browsers.

        div class="sticky-top">.../div


                                                    Responsive sticky top

        Responsive variations also exist for .sticky-top utility.
        div class="sticky-sm-top">Stick to the top on viewports sized SM (small) or wider
        div class="sticky-md-top">Stick to the top on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider
        div class="sticky-lg-top">Stick to the top on viewports sized LG (large) or wider
        div class="sticky-xl-top">Stick to the top on viewports sized XL (extra-large) or wider
